		How to get rid of acne scars naturally with Home-Made Chemical Peels
		</p>
		
 
<p>In <q>How to get rid of Acne Scars - Part 1</q>, we talked about the start of my journey. I refused to have another acne scar on my face and so I took action. I wanted to get aggressive, but at the same time, I didn't want to get too aggressive for fear of chickening-out at the last minute.</p>

<p>I'm a Scurdy-Cat, I admit this.</p>

<p>I started my journey with a natural Sugar Exfoliate and a Lemon-based Face Mask. If you're just starting to research how to get rid of your acne scars, I highly recommend that you read Part 1.</p>

<p>A couple of months passed and I started to see that some of my scars had indeed started to fade with this safe, yet aggressive regiment.</p>

<p>Stoked that I didn't burn my face off (I'm highly over-exaggerating btw), I decided that I was ready to start Phase 2: Home-Made Chemical Peels.</p>


<h2>Confession Time</h2>

<p>I want to preface this section by first confessing that I prefer to do my Chemical Peels with my aesthetician. If you can afford it, I highly recommend that you go to a professional to get this done- whether your aesthetician or your dermatologist.</p>

<p>I'm not a DIY Die-Hard. I was just broke at the time. When I decided to try this method, I knew that I wouldn't be able to do multiple sessions in a spa while making <q>Waitress-Wages</q>.</p>


<h2>What the Eff is a Chemical Peel, exactly?</h2>

<p>All in all, a Chemical Peel is applying an acid to your face.</p>

<p>I know, I know. When I learned this, I freaked out. </p>

<p>I had to bookmark the recipe and do my research prior to even considering doing this to myself.</p>

<p>But rest assured, chemical peels are a normal, proven, process.</p>

<p>When the acid is applied, it starts to break away at the upper-most portion of your skin- the epidermis. The body then renews the skin cells with new cells. So any imperfections slowly <q>turn over</q> and slowly metabolize the imperfection.</p>

<p>To me, the best but most ugly analogy would be like shaving tree bark from a tree.  If you shave off a little, the bark will grow back. But, if your rebel motorcycle-riding boyfriend carves both of your names deep enough, the tree will <q>scar</q>.</p>

<p>A sweet sentiment for you, a seemingly permanent tattoo for the tree.</p>

<p>Now, this analogy also has a second meaning. Chemical Peels are not meant for Keloid or Raised Scars (as in our fabulously romantic tree-scar analogy). If you do not know what a raised scar is, please read <q>How to get rid of Acne Scars - Part 1</q>.</p>

<p>I will write about how I'm starting to remove these types of scars in my next post, which will be about microdermabrasion (ie: sand those buggers down).</p>

<p>What should you expect from a Chemical Peel?
<ul>
	<li>Correct Sun-Damaged skin cells</li>
	<li>Reduce small indented scars</li>
	<li>Eradicate wrinkles on the skin</li>
	<li>Remove dark pimple marks on your skin</li>
	<li>Remove stubborn blackheads</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>What a Chemical Peel will not do:
<ul>
	<li>Remove rosacea or hyperpigmentation. Trust me, it will do more harm than good.</li>
	<li>Change your pore diameter. I have a Clay-Mask recommendation for this.</li>
	<li>Give you a face-lift or magically cause unicorns to dance on your front lawn.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Types of Chemical Peels</h2>

<p>As I said earlier, a Chemical Peel is the application of Acid to your face. It's ok, in time you will stop thinking of this as a scary thing and more of a good thing.</p>

<p>Now, it's important to understand that Chemical Peels are categorized by how strong the applied acid is. </p>

<p>The Chemical Peel that we will be making is a Superficial Peel. We want to slowly and systematically get rid of our acne scars over time with the least amount of risk. We want a little acid spread over multiple sessions.</p>

<p>Here's the breakdown:
<br>

<dl>
	<dt><u>EXTRA SUPERFICIAL:</u></dt><br>
		<dd>Low Glycolic Acid, just like our Sugar Exfoliate, or Renova Wrinkle Cream. Extra Superficial Peels remove only the tippy-top layer of the epidermis.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>SUPERFICIAL:</u></dt><br>
		<dd>Low TCA, Jessner's Solution or Salicylic Acid (our recipe). Your aesthetician will usually apply this type of Chemical Peel to your face. It is the most productive towards helping fade acne scars over time. It's also the safest that I believe you should do on your own.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>MEDIUM:</u></dt><br>
		<dd>Higher Level Glycolic Acid or Higher Level TCA. This stuff will penetrate through the epidermis and into the tippy-top of your dermis. I do not recommend that you do this on your own. This is moving into a <q>serious</q> territory that you should reserve only for your dermatologist as they're theoretically burning your skin.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>DEEP:</u></dt><br>
		<dd>Phenol Acid. I would consider this a skin operation. This is the serious-of-the-serious and involves burning through your epidermis and through to the inner parts of the dermis. From what I read, an anesthesiologist is present so that you don't scream from the pain and everything is done in a medical environment.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>As a professed Scurdy Cat, I would only do this under two circumstances: 
<ol>
	<li>I was somehow turned into one of the monsters from Wrong Turn.</li><br>
	<li>The Joker kidnapped me and burned half of my face off with an explosion because Batman went to the wrong location.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>I do not foresee these things ever happening to me.</p>

<h3>Preparing your face for The Peel</h3>

<p>There are a few things that you could do to make your Peel more effective and to reduce the amount of healing time required. I learned this, of course, from my aesthetician months after I stopped doing my own Chemical Peels.</p>

<p>So, in my opinion, this stuff is definitely not required. Back then, all I did was stopped applying my Lemon Face Mask one week prior to my Chemical Peel Treatment.</p>

<p>But, after seeing a professional, I learned about these things and have since followed their instruction.</p>

<p>When you go to your dermatologist, she may prescribe Retin-A for you to apply to your face in preparation for your Chemical Peel. They will then instruct you to cease using Retin-A 3-4 days prior to your Chemical Peel appointment.</p>

<p>Since we will be using one of the weakest of the Superficial Chemical Peels, you could use a Retinol serum as a cheap replacement. I use a Retinol serum, every night, weeks before I go to see my aesthetician. </p>

<p>You want something that is 2.5% Retinol with proof of this in its ingredients.</p>

<p>As per Dermatologist protocol, I stop using Retinol 3-4 days before the day I plan to receive Treatment.</p>

<p>Professionals also advise against removing facial hair [waxing, shaving, electrolysis, depilatory creams and laser hair removal] prior to receiving a Chemical Peel. If you have a girl-stache and absolutely need to, then I would just recommend that you be very careful.</p>

<h2>Salicylic Acid, and why I want you to put Aspirin on your face.</h2>

<p>A Salicylic Acid Peel is the mildest out of the Superficial Peels and thus the best option for treating yourself at home. Salicylic Acid itself is made from willow-bark (this is where aspirin comes from) and it is used for a variety of skin treatments.</p>

<p>Salicylic Acid is even found in everyday products like shampoo to treat dandruff.</p>

<p>A few notes about the ingredients before we go to our Shopping List.</p>

<h3>Things to know about Aspirin</h3>

<p>We want an aspirin that has as few fillers as possible, so, Bayer should be a last resort. There are two brands that I do recommend: Walmart's Equate brand of Aspirin or Geri-Care Aspirin, which I found on Amazon.</p>

<p>I do <u>not</u> recommend this Chemical Peel to those who are allergic to NSAIDs- Aleve, Advil, Motrin, Celebrex, etc. If you can't ingest these things, then it's fair to assume that you shouldnâ€™t let it sit on your skin for any amount of time either. You have been warned.</p>


<h2>Things to know about Lemon Juice</h2>

<p>Always spot-test your diluted lemon-juice. A little bit on the skin behind your ear will quickly tell you if this stuff will tickle, tingle or make you feel like your skin is on fire.</p>

<p>After using this Peel, your skin will be sensitive to UV light. That means SPF 30 Moisturizer, Toner, or Sunblock and Aloe Vera. Do not tan after using this Peel. Please don't.</p>

<p>It is a rarity, but if you have any allergies related to Lemon, Lime, Orange, etcetera then do not continue.</p>

<h3>Now, Let's Get Rid of Those Acne Scars!</h3>

<p>Ok, now that you understand what you are getting yourself into, it's time to get started. This recipe was found online and has been modified through multiple friends who are aestheticians and professional facialists to get the best results.</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>Ingredients</strong></dt><br>
		<dd>1 Cup of Witch Hazel, for priming your face.</dd><br>
		<dd>Cotton Balls or Squares, for priming your face.</dd><br>
		<dd>1-4 Aspirin tablets, this will be our source of Salicylic Acid.</dd><br>
		<dd>1 Tbsp of Lemon Juice, this will make the Salicylic Acid more soluble in water and Vitamin C is a proven lightening agent.</dd><br>
		<dd>1 Tbsp of a Propel Fitness Water or any less-alkaline water.</dd><br>
		<dd>2 Tbsp of Baking Soda</dd><br>
		<dd>2 Cups of cold Evian or more-alkaline water</dd><br>
		<dd>1 small non-metallic bowl for the Peeling Solution.</dd><br>
		<dd>1 bigger non-metallic bowl for the Neutralizing Solution.</dd><br>
		<dd>1 applicator. This can be a brush or a box of gauze or cotton-tipped applicators. No metallic material, you are working with acids.</dd><br>
		<dd>1 timer so that you don't accidentally burn your face off, I'm only half joking, but don't be scared.</dd><br>
		<dd></dd><br>
</dl>

<h3>Directions-Peeling Solution (Small Bowl)</h3>

<dl>
	<dd>Take <q>Before</q> photo to compare later and get your Small bowl out.</dd><br>

	<dd>Add 1 Tbsp of Propel Fitness water into your bowl. We want to use a less-alkaline water so we don't neutralize the lemon juice.</dd><br>

	<dd>Add 1 Tbsp of lemon juice. If your skin is sensitive to lemon then I highly recommend that you slowly drop lemon juice into the solution and spot-test it behind your ear. Remember though, Aspirin is less than 1% soluble in water. The amount of lemon juice in your bowl will determine how well the Aspirin dissolves into the solution.  You could add up to 2 Tbsp if you're not sensitive to lemon juice at all.</dd><br>

	<dd>Crush 1-4 Aspirin Tablets as fine as you can and add them to your bowl.</dd><br>

	<dd>Stir and add more crushed Aspirin until the ingredients thicken into an almost honey-like consistency. You want it to be runny but not watery.</dd><br>

	<dd>This is your Peeling Solution. Set this aside for now.</dd><br>

	<dd>WARNING: Do not mix-up your bowls. Use different colored bowls or labels if you have to.</dd><br>
</dl>

<h3>Directions - Neutralizing Solution (Bigger bowl)</h3>

<dl>
	<dd>In your bigger bowl, add 2-cups of cold Evian or more-alkaline water.</dd><br>
	<dd>Mix in 2 Tbsp of Baking Soda and stir.</dd><br>
	<dd>Add a hand full of ice cubes in the bowl to keep the water cool.</dd><br>
	<dd>This is your Neutralizing Solution, this is how you will wash away the acid and ensure that it will not go any deeper than you want it to.</dd><br>
	<dd>Again, DO NOT MIX-UP YOUR BOWLS. </dd><br>
</dl>

<h3>How to Use</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><u>PRIMING:</u></dt><br>
		<dd>Priming is the process of using an astringent to get dirt and oils off of your face so that the Peel can have direct contact with your skin.</dd><br>
		<dd>Use the cotton balls or cotton squares to thoroughly wipe your face with Witch Hazel.</dd><br>
		<dd>Pat your skin dry with a clean towel.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>PEELING:</u></dt><br>
		<dd>Evenly apply the Peel to your face with your applicator. Be careful not to get the Peel in your eyes, mouth, inside your nose or on the vermillion of your lip- the raised area where your lip meets the rest of your face.</dd><br>
		<dd>After fully applying the Peel, set your timer for 10 minutes. You may feel tingling or slight burning. If you feel any pain, immediately wash your face with your Neutralizing Solution.</dd><br>
		<dd>Get your Neutralizing Solution ready.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>NEUTRALIZING:</u></dt><br>
		<dd>After 10 minutes, wash your face with the cold Neutralizing Solution. Make sure that it's all washed away and no acid remains on your face at all. The cool water will feel absolutely fabulous and you will almost instantly realize that your face looks smoother. I also recommend that you have a clean electric fan nearby to allow the cool air to blow on your face. I just personally like doing this because it makes my face feel so minty fresh.</dd><br>
</dl>
	

<h2>HOLY MOLY! I'M RED, DRYING AND PEELING!</h2>

<p>Expect this. Post Treatment, you will experience some tightness in your skin, some red spots and skin dryness. You skin will feel a bit more sensitive also, just don't freak out.</p>

<p>Sensitivity should be mostly gone by the next day.</p>

<p>You will also start to notice a bit of peeling and flaking on your face. No, you're not melting. This is normal and will last between 3 to 5 days. </p>

<p>Peeling skin should be allowed to slough off naturally. Picking and pulling at the skin is definitely not advised. Remember, you just applied a mild acid to your face and the epidermis of your skin is going to start regenerating skin cells and metabolizing imperfections- these imperfections slough off as dead skin.</p>

<p>Again, don't freak out. These things are normal. Below are my recommendations:</p>

<p>Redness can be covered with a breathable foundation. I personally recommend Lycogel Camouflage Foundation. It is completely breathable and will not irritate your skin post-treatment. Perfect for covering any redness.</p>

<p>Skin dryness can be remedied with SPF-30 moisturizer. Protecting your face from harmful UV light is important- so that means no tanning for at least a week. </p>

<p>Depending on how quickly your face heals, you may do follow-up treatments in 2-5 week intervals until you achieve your desired results.</p>

<h3>Are Chemical Peels Worth it?</h3>

<p>There are many benefits to Chemical Peel treatments and if you are not satisfied with just exfoliating and using face masks, then a Peel is the best Next Step to take.</p>

<p>After I started to do my own Chemical Peels, I almost immediately started to see the difference. I couldn't believe it. I actually started to like who I was seeing in the mirror each morning.</p>

<p>I liked it so much that I decided that going to a spa to get a professional Chemical Peel was worth the money. I did it and did not regret it. I cannot recommend this enough. Going to a professional is worth it. You can walk in, get your treatment, apply your UV Protection and then leave the spa. No prep, no clean-up and no worrying about whether you applied too much or not enough. But, back then, this was all I had- and if you're in the same boat that I was, then this DIY Chemical Peel is definitely better than nothing.</p>

<p>In my next post, I will go over how I started to get rid of my Raised Scars with microdermabrasion. I hope that you found <q>How to Get Rid of Acne Scars, Part 2</q> informative!</p>
