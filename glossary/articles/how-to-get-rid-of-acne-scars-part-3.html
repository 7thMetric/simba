<h2>Saying Goodbye to my Acne Scars, forever.</h2>

<p>I can remember the person that I was 10 months ago and I can't believe how much I've changed.</p>

<p>For example, prior to this journey, I never wore my hair in a pony-tail. I relied on my hair as a barrier between my face and the world. I simply didn't want people to see me.</p>

<p>I would get a queasy feeling in my stomach whenever someone invited me to a party. I remember how I'd run away, fake illness or cry <q>busy</q>. And if those options failed then I would find myself playing a single-player game of <q>People-Dodging</q> until I eventually escaped.</p>

<p>It was pathetic. I spent so many years of my life hiding from people in more ways than just this.</p>

<p>Then, one day, I decided to take my fate in my own hands. And I never turned back.</p>

<h2>How I reduced my Acne Scars in one evening</h2>

<p>Oh how I loved seeing each improvement. I remember feeling so stoked! It wasn't vanity for me, it was finding peace. I honestly didn't know what was holding me back all of these years.</p>

<p>I started my journey with a Sugar Exfoliate and Lemon Face Mask routine.</p>

<p>Then I stepped-up my routine with Chemical Peels. After my follow-up treatments, my smaller indented scars were very shallow and almost invisible.</p>

<p>Next in line was to get rid of my raised scars.</p>

<p>I started doing research on possible solutions and settled on Microdermabrasion. I remember finding Microdermabrasion Before and After Photos and wanting results just like that.</p>

<p>Weeks later, I went to my dermatologist and got my first microdermabrasion treatment.</p>

<p>After I left the Dermatology Office, I was as red as a turnip. But, from my experience with Chemical Peels, I understood that the results are usually revealed days later. After four days, I saw significant fading in all of my scars, both raised and indented.</p>

<p>So much more than I expected!</p>

<p>But, reality soon sunk-in and I knew that I couldn’t possibly afford follow-up treatments for the recommended 6-10 treatments.</p>

<p>I was so mad. I didn't improve this much, just to give up now. So, I decided to find a home equivalent, and I did. And trust me, I'm happy that I did.</p>

<p>But first thing's first: What exactly is Microdermabrasion?</p>

<h2><q>Derm</q> means skin and <q>Abrasion</q> means scrape! Yikes!</h2>

<p>My first consultation with my dermatologist helped me understand exactly what was about to happen to me and put a lot of my <q>Scary Unknowns</q> to rest.</p>

<p><q>Like anything else, it highly depends on pain tolerance. A few of my Client's say it was a mild pain like plucking your eyebrows, most say that they don't feel any pain at all.</q> said Dr. April, My dermatologist.</p>

<p><q>Actually,</q> she continued, <q>it's probably the gentlest of the non-invasive scar fading procedures available right now.</q></p>

<p><blockquote><q style="font-size:140%">A slight pink appearance following a treatment usually lasts only a few hours. You can return to work or other commitments immediately following your treatment.</blockquote></q>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>- Brook Craze</strong>, Aesthetician- Viginia Surgical Arts LLC.</p>

<p>And after my procedure, I totally agreed. Microdermabrasion didn't hurt like expected.</p>

<p>The more I learned, the more I realized that I should have done this a lot earlier. If you were like me and completely clueless about Microdermabrasion, then here's the breakdown:</p>

<p>Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive procedure that can be done with your dermatologist, aesthetician or even at home on your own.</p>

<p>In short, a tiny wand is placed on your face that does two things:
	<ul>
		<li>Rotates super tiny crystals on your face to remove the outer-most layer of your epidermis. This is done with either a diamond disk or crystal spray. I would suggest a diamond-based treatment as crystals cannot be used anywhere near your eyes. Crystals will also leave you feeling like you spent an hour in a sandbox.</li><br>
		<li>Activates a vacuum that sucks up the tiny crystals as well as the dead skin it removed.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>This method encourages the younger skin cells underneath to produce higher levels of collagen and elastin. This process, just like a Chemical Peel, allows your skin to slowly metabolize skin imperfections like wrinkles and Acne Scars.</p>

<p>But unlike a Chemical Peel, it's a mechanical process and thus better for eliminating raised scars.</p>

<h2>The Different Types of Exfoliation</h2>

<p>Through my journey, I learned that not all exfoliation is considered equal. This process has various levels which highly depends on the method of exfoliation that you choose.</p>

<p>
	<dl>
		<dt><u>MANUAL EXFOLIATION:</u></dt><br>
			<dd>This is the process of physically scrubbing your face with a face-scrub. This is exactly where I started my journey when I used the Sugar Exfoliate. The best results that you can expect from just this method is to remove the tippy-top of the epidermis.</dd><br>
		<dt><u>CHEMICAL EXFOLIATION:</u></dt><br>
			<dd>This is where Chemical Peels come into the picture. This process involves applying acid to your face to help you skin shed faster. You can expect for Chemical Exfoliates to penetrate deeper into your epidermis. If you have shallow indented scars, Chemical Exfoliation is where you will start to see improvement.</dd><br>
		<dt><u>MECHANICAL EXFOLIATION:</u></dt><br>
			<dd>This is where Microdermabrasion is Queen. This process involves pretty much sanding down your raised scars while also encouraging your skin to increase collagen and elastin production. The result is a gradual flattening of your raised scars while the collagen slowly starts to fill-in your indented scars.</dd>
	</dl>
</p>

<h3>Ladies, its biology, not magic— even though it seems like it.</h3>

<p>Just like with Chemical Peels, there are a few things that you should expect from the process, and other things that are common misconceptions and just pure baloney.</p>

<p><blockquote><q style="font-size:140%">In order to improve the appearance of stretch marks you need a more aggressive laser resurfacing treatment, such as Fraxel laser.</blockquote></q>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>- Dr. Gregory Turowski MD</strong>, Chicago Plastic Surgery</p>

<p>What you should expect from Microdermabrasion:
	<ul>
		<li>Improve Hyperpigmentation</li>
		<li>Reduce Fine-Lines and Wrinkles</li>
		<li>Reduce or eliminate enlarged pores</li>
		<li>Treat minor to mild raised and indented acne scars</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Microdermabrasion will not:
	<ul>
		<li>Remove Stretch-Marks, you may get a temporary effect of lightening them.</li>
		<li>Make you look 20 years younger in a 20 minute session.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>What to do <u>before</u> you get Microdermabrasion</h3>

<p>If you decide that Microdermabrasion is the route that you want to take, then I recommend that you first book an appointment with your dermatologist or Aesthetician for a consultation.</p>

<p>You want to answer two questions:
	<ul>
		<li>Are your goals even attainable with microdermabrasion?</li>
		<li>How much would the recommended sessions cost versus doing it yourself?</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>To reduce the amount of time between consultation and treatment, I recommend that you follow these guidelines prior to the day that you want to start: </p>

<p>No Chemicals that would affect your skin's sensitivity at least 3 days prior. This means any skin care products that contain Acids[AHA, BHA, Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid, etcetera], Vitamin-A [Retin-A or Retinol] and even any blood thinners like Aspirin.</p>

<p>Completely avoid the spa for 2-3 weeks prior. This means, no tanning for at least a week prior. No Collagen injections or Botox at least 3 weeks prior, and no removal of facial hair [waxing, shaving, electrolysis, depilatory creams and laser hair removal] at least 3 week prior.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a girl-stache and absolutely need to remove it, then I would recommend that you be very careful, no cuts, irritated skin or razor burns.</p>

<p>Now, I'm going to assume that you are in the same situation that I found myself in:</p>

<p>You can't possibly afford the amount of follow-up sessions that they're recommending and Home Treatment is the most cost-effective method available to you right now.</p>

<h2>The Most Convenient Microdermabrasion Machine ever!</h2>

<p>When looking for a Microdermabrasion at home Kit, I found that they were separated into three distinct categories, each with its own benefits and down-sides. These categories are:
	<ul>
		<li>Hand-Held</li>
		<li>Portable</li>
		<li>Stationary</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><strong><u>HAND-HELD</u></strong>: Handheld's have the benefit of being super portable. They don't have many options but the trade-off is in the price, which usually ranges between $99.00 - $179.00. I personally recommend the following in the Hand-Held Category:
	<ul>
		<li><u>PMD Personal Microderm Kit</u> - 5 out of 5 Stars</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>I personally own the PMD Personal Microdermabrasion Kit and I find it to be more than sufficient for comparable results to a professional treatment.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the PMD Microdermabrasion Kit- especially for someone who's never tried Microdermabrasion at home before and don't want to buy a big complicated machine.</p>

<p>The $179.00 price-tag is a bit steep, but it will give you a comparable microdermabrasion treatment for far less than the recommended 6-10 visits to your dermatologist- which totals into the thousands.</p>

<p>When I first got it, I used it weekly with the <q>Sensitive</q> abrasion disk and per the instructions I started to use it less and less. Now, because of its size, I only take it with me when I visit my parent’s for the weekend.  This has nothing to do with its effectiveness; it's just that I own a more pricey kit now.</p>

<p>There are a few things that I don't like about the PMD:</p>

<p>First, is that you can't control the suction of the machine. I now own and regularly use the Microderm MD Machine that does have varying levels of suction. I simply set it to <q>Auto</q> and let it instruct me on which area of my face to use it on.</p>

<p>Second, is that you have to change the abrasion disks every 3 uses. It will cost you $15.00-$20.00 for about 3 months' worth. Trust me, all of the horror stories that I’ve heard regarding the PMD was due to someone using the same disk 5, 6 or even 7 times without changing it. This is the equivalent of shaving with a dull razor, ouch!</p>

<p>You can read my Full Review of the PMD Personal Microderm Kit here.
	<ul>
		<li><u>ReVit by Silk'n</u> - 4 out of 5 Stars</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The ReVit Microdermabrasion Kit was tested out by my friend Josephine. Retail price for a ReVit is $99.00. When Josephine first received the ReVit, she talked about it for nearly six months, making me feel like a moron for buying the PMD. I still stand by my PMD though.</p>

<p>There is one feature that I saw in the ReVit that is not available in the PMD, which is suction control. Which means you can use less suction on thinner skinned areas and more suction on thicker skinned areas.</p>

<p>According to Josephine, you still need to change the abrasion disks every 3 uses. I guess that's just a normal thing when it comes to hand-held devices.</p>

<p>I really don't have first-hand experience with the ReVit, but Josephine speaks so highly of it. I've also seen the changes that it’s made in her acne scars. I believe that the ReVit works just as well as the PMD- with the added benefits of suction control and costing only $99.00.</p>

<p>The only negative occurred almost 10 months later when it finally broke down. BTW, My PMD is still going strong. Lol.</p>

<p><blockquote><q style="font-size:140%">Wake up in the morning feeling 30, looking 30 and being able to behave like 30</q></blockquote>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>- Dr. Oz</strong>, The Dr. Oz Show (speakng about the PMD System)</p>

<p>NOTE: I saw PMD on Dr. Oz and thought this quote was divine. I really like the idea that when I'm 40, I would be more than capable of looking 10 years younger!</p>

<p><stong><u>SEMI-PORTABLE:</stong></u> I call this type of System <q>Semi-Portable</q> because they come attached to a docking station- definitely not as portable as the PMD. The benefit of having a docking station is that it provides better suction and the option of varying degrees of suction.
	<ul>
		<li><u>Microderm MD By Trophy Skin</u></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>This is the System that I currently own. I'm completely satisfied with it and I'm still contemplating whether or not I should even upgrade this system to something pricier.</p>

<p>Something inside me is saying, <q>If it ain't broke, then don't fix it.</q></p>

<p>In my opinion, this machine has everything that I ever wanted in a microdermabrasion machine. Here are some of the key points that I'm absolutely in love with:
	<ul>
		<li>The AUTO function. This machine will actually tell you where to use it and will automatically adjust the suction. This function made the machine worth every penny.</li><br>
		<li>It is considerably quieter than my PMD System. I couldn't believe that a machine twice the size of my PMD system could be significantly quieter. Love it!</li><br>
		<li>The suction is perfect. Combined with the AUTO function, this machine has never left me with face hickeys. Now, this thing is <u>strong</u>, but if you follow the directions and don't linger in one spot, you won't damage your face. I haven't.</li><br>
		<li>The diamond tip lasts way longer than my PMD system's diamond disks. I've used this system for about six months before I decided that I should replace the tip.</li><br>
		<li>It wasn’t losing its effectiveness at all, but I just felt that six months was <u>way</u> too long and the tip needed to be replaced. I do not know how long you can use a single tip before it actually needs replacing.</li><br>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>There are a few things that I didn’t like about the machine but for me, these things are tolerable and the benefits highly out-weigh my complaints.
	<ul>
		<li>A new tip will cost $50.00 to replace. The PMD System’s disks cost $20.00 for a pack of disks so I was initially shocked. But considering that I got about 6 months worth of usage out of the original tip, I decided that it's worth the money.</li><br>
		<li>The plug is foreign and comes with an adaptor for use in the United States. This took me a minute to actually trust it and plug it into my wall outlet. But trust me, it's not gonna start sparking or exploding- it's safe.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>You can read my full review of the Microderm MD System here.</p>

<p><strong><u>STATIONARY:</u></strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Sylvan Inc. SYL-08XLT Multifunction Microdermabrasion Machine</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>This monster is definitely not portable and honestly looks a bit intimidating. My Microderm MD Unit is a Toyota compared to this Lamborghini.</p>

<p>But again, I'm very comfortable with my little Microderm MD System. If I had the money, I would definitely at least <u>think</u> about buying this.</p>

<p>I mean, look at it. It looks like it would definitely deliver some great results.</p>

<p>At a whopping $647.00, only the serious-of-the-serious would lust over this machine. It comes with all sorts of goodies that I would only expect from a spa environment. This would seriously be like taking your aesthetician's unit home with you.</p>

<p>Two extras that caught my eye are:
	<dl>
		<dt><u>Hot and Cold Hammer Treatment.</u></dt><br>
			<dd>This is used to Open and Close pores. Really cool.</dd><br>
		<dt><u>Ultrasonic Scrubber.</u></dt><br>
			<dd>This attachment exfoliates your skin with technology that I have never even heard of before: Ultrasonic Exfoliation. It uses 28,000 vibrations per second and ultrasound to penetrate to the lower layers of the dermis- reviving skin tissue and blood-flow.</dd>
	</dl>
</p>

<p>Again, if you really want to take it to the absolute highest level and want a professional tool in your home, then this is it.</p>

<h2>The 3 Microdermabrasion Machines to <u>Stay Away</u> from!</h2>

<p>Below are the microdermabrasion machines that I would definitely stay away from. Some of them are heavily marketed but trust me, don’t believe the hype.
	<ul>
		<li><u>New Spa Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine</u></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>I'm referring to the <q>Digital Pen</q> model. I do not have any experience with any of the other New Spa models even though their Amazon Reviews seem to be pretty high.</p>

<p>This was my very first <q>real</q> handheld model that I purchased. I returned this model soon after receiving it. This was due to both the machine itself and the seller.</p>

<p>This is what happened:</p>

<p>When I first started doing my research on microdermabrasion machines, I did not have enough money to buy the machine that I wanted (The PMD System). So, I took a chance and foolishly purchased the New Spa Diamond Microdermabrasion Pen- as it looked <q>close enough</q> to me.</p>

<p>You see, I'm from the Walmart Generation and I tend to buy cheaper things that look <q>close enough</q> to the thing that I <u>actually want</u> to buy.</p>

<p>Now that I look back at it, I should have just purchased the thing that I actually wanted.</p>

<p>When I first got this machine, I realized that it was battery operated. I did not like this at all. I didn't like the fact that the fate of my face relied on a battery.</p>

<p>But, it was still <q>close enough</q> to me and so I charged it for the entire night and attempted to use it in the morning.</p>

<p>Emphasis on <q>attempted</q>.</p>

<p>When I turned it on, the machine came to life and buzzed a lot- but, it had no suction.</p>

<p>I quickly rifled through the package for the instruction manual. There was none. I then went back to Amazon and re-read the description. And indeed, suction was listed in the description.</p>

<p>After a lengthy back-and-forth with the Amazon Seller, he or she agreed that I would send the machine back to them and they would replace it. I would pay for shipping them the broken machine (even though it's not my fault) and they would pay for shipping me a new one.</p>

<p>Ok. I didn't think that it was a fair deal but, ok.</p>

<p>The second machine that I received wouldn't hold a charge. I learned this after wasting an entire night attempting to charge it. At that point, I gave up and requested a refund.</p>

<p>After more back-and-forth with the Seller and a threat to post a lengthy, very articulate negative review; the seller gave me a refund.</p>

<p>I then cursed Walmart for indoctrinating me with the <q>good enough</q> mentality. Because the truth is: Dr. Bob Cola is <u>not</u> the same as Dr. Pepper.</p>

<p>The only good thing that came from ordering the New Spa Microdermabrasion Pen was that it acted somewhat like a savings account. When I finally received my $85.00 refund, it combined with my paycheck and allowed me to purchase the PMD System.</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li><u>Nubrilliance At-Home Microdermabrasion System</u></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>My mom bought me this machine for my birthday. This was right between returning the New Spa Microdermabrasion Pen and purchasing the PMD System.</p>

<p>You don't know how stoked I was when she gave it to me. Up until that point, my budget was locked at $200.00 for a microdermabrasion machine. NuBrilliance was just slightly out of my budget and it annoyed me. I'd seen all of the commercials, read all about it online and told my mom on multiple occasions that I was going to buy the machine for myself one day.</p>

<p>I loved the clam-shell shape of the NuBrilliance Microdermabrasion System as well as the little compartment that held all the extras. But my enthusiasm ended there. When I used the system for the first time, I soon learned three things:
	<ol>
		<li>The machine is extremely loud. Since the plastic is so thin, it also rattled. The rattling mixed with the sound of the actual machine was super distracting. If my mom didn't spend $245.00 on this machine, I would have stopped using it just for this reason.</li><br>
		<li>The instructions recommend going over the same area repeatedly. Not knowing any better, I followed these directions and ended up with red streaks on my face. These streaks lasted approximately two weeks.</li><br>
		<p>The entire time was spent praying that the streaks didn't scar. If it wasn't for Aloe Vera, I probably would be living the rest of my life as a tiger right now.</p><br>
		<li>The suction is mediocre at best. From all the noise that it made, you'd think that it was attached to a Hoover. Nope, it was just a very noisy, irritating machine.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>I've also read negative reviews about the o-ring that connects the tubing to the machine. This o-ring breaks very, very easily- causing the machine to become useless almost overnight.</p>

<p>Eventually, after about 5 uses, my NuBrilliance System died. I soon renamed it NoBrilliance- my big, clam-shell shaped, $245.00, paper-weight. Their 30 day Guarantee is exactly that, 30 days until the machine self-destructs and makes you sad.</p>

<p>My advice: Avoid NuBrilliance unless you're willing to just toss your money down an endless pit.
	<ul>
		<li><u>Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System</u></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>About 3 or 4 years ago, the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System introduced me to the idea of mechanical exfoliation. I first saw this as the Skin Care version of an electronic toothbrush so it made sense to me. A machine <u>should</u> be able to do most of your exfoliating for you.</p>

<p><q>Work smarter, not harder</q>, I thought.</p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>I know, I know, comparing a $20.00 machine to a $179.00 machine is like comparing an iPhone to one of those big block phones from the 1980’s- they're simply not in the same league!</p>

<p>But, I feel like it deserves mention.</p>

<p>About a month ago, while chatting with my girls about microdermabrasion and what it's done for me, the Neutrogena System came into the conversation.</p>

<p>These are my thoughts and feelings about the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System:
	<ul>Things I liked:
		<li>One of the best things about the Neutrogena System is the price. The price to try this machine isn't high and if you're like me, it would seem like the most logical first attempt- especially since it's so readily available from places like Walmart.</li><br>
		<li>The next thing I liked about the Neutrogena System was that it allowed me to experiment with mechanical exfoliation. It was like my training wheels.</li><br>
	</ul>
	<ul>But again, you get what you pay for. These are the things I didn't like:
		<li>The Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System runs on AA batteries. Three or four years ago, I thought that this was really cool. I have since realized that a steady power source (ie: it plugs into the wall outlet) is absolutely necessary for something like this.</li><br>
		<p>Nothing is worse than having a machine die on you or slow down when you're half-way through your treatment.</p><br>
		<li>I also didn't like the fact that the design is very deceiving. When I first bought the Neutrogena System, I thought that it would rotate so that I could theoretically <q>grind off</q> my scars.</li><br>
		<p>This was not true and I soon discovered that the machine actually just vibrates.</p>
</p>

<p>But since I knew nothing about microdermabrasion at the time, I vibrated my face for a month until the batteries died.</p>

<p>My skin did feel slightly smoother after using the machine. It felt just like if I were to use my Sugar Exfoliate but it took a lot longer to accomplish with the System because it didnt rotate.</p>

<p>Actually, the instructions tell you to hold the machine in one spot for about 2-3 minutes. It took me about 20 minutes to do my entire face. I even remember that at one point, I just used the machine as a handle and exfoliated with the pads manually. It was a lot quicker that way.</p>

<p>I also didn't like the smell of the soapy sandpaper pads. I was using an apricot scrub up until that point and I enjoyed the smell of it. This smelled really <q>chemically</q>.</p>

<p>So, is it worth buying?</p>

<p>Overall, this machine costs $20.00 and you will get $20.00 worth of machine. In my opinion, you would be better off forgoing the Neutrogena Vibrating Handle and just buying exfoliating pads.</p>

<h2>How to Use your Microdermabrasion Machine - Instructions</h2>

<p><b>Step 1.</b> Wash your Face and Pat dry</p>

<p><b>Step 2.</b> Choose your Abrasion Disk.
<p>Most of these products will allow you to change disks or tips to vary the abrasiveness that you want to use on your skin. If you're just starting out, I recommend using the most sensitive disk and working your way up to your limit.</p>
</p>

<p><b>Step 3.</b> Start with the lowest Suction Level on your jaw-line. 

<p>Now, some products have this feature and some do not.  For example, PMD. </p>

<p>Since PMD only has an ON-OFF switch, my tip for doing this is to 1. Go over your skin very quickly, do not linger or the machine will give you a face-hickey. 2. Hold meaty areas taught before you go over them. I definitely do not go over the same area twice. This is so that it doesn't over-exfoliate your skin, causing all kinds of ugly problems.</p>

<p>Now that I own a Microderm MD System, I can't even begin to explain how important variable suction is. This feature means that you can use more suction on areas that are thicker like your cheeks, forehead and nose. You can then use less suction on thinner places like your cheek-bones, jaw-line and under your eyes.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Step 4.</b> Continue on the lowest Suction: Cheekbones and under your eyes.</p>

<p>Again, I do not recommend that you go over the same spots more than once- at least not for your first time using it. You are in essence scraping your face with a diamond-tip. I would start light and work your way up to your limit. Results will vary from product to product.</p>

<p>I would not go over the same area with the PMD- especially on the areas that have thinner skin like my jaw-line and cheekbones.</p>

<p><b>Step 5.</b> Step-Up your Suction Level to 2 or maybe 3 depending on your sensitivity.</p>

<p>Start using the system on the meatier areas like your cheeks. If you have <q>saggy</q> cheeks then I recommend that you use your hand to make the skin more taught before going over it.</p>


<p>Again, I wouldn't advise going over the same area twice. Just go over it once and see how sensitive your skin is to the product.</p>

<p>I'm repeating myself because I'm trying to save you from red-streaks on your face.</p>

<p>The Microderm MD System's <q>Auto</q> function walks me through this entire process. I just follow the directions on the screen and the suction levels change automatically. I can't even explain how much I absolutely love this function!</p>

<p><b>Step 6.</b> Add Toner or Moisturizer to your face and SPF-30 if it’s the day time.</p>

<p>Now is the time to apply whatever skin products that really help you. Of course, this doesn't mean to add any Acids to your face- I'm talking about Aloe or Moisturizers. The dead skin is completely gone and whatever you apply will soak directly into newer, younger skin.</p>

<p>It's recommended that you wear SPF-30 if you're going to be in direct contact with the sun. Do not tan at all while you're going through Microdermabrasion treatments.</p>

<h3><q>My Face is so sensitive!</q>and other Post-Treatment Concerns.</h3>

<p>You skin will look rosy immediately after treatment. This is normal and most of the redness will go way after a couple of hours. You just removed the top portion of your skin and your skin will react to this.</p>

<p>You will also notice that your skin feels a lot softer and is very sensitive for 2-3 days.</p>

<p>Things that you <u>should not</u> do post-treatment:
	<ul>
		<li>Do not scratch or pick at your skin, it will only further irritate your skin.</li><br>
		<li>Do not go out in direct sunlight for at least 7 days. If you go out in the sun, wear SPF 30.</li><br>
		<li>Do not wax, shave or use depilatory creams on your face for 7 days- sorry ladies.</li><br>
		<li>Do not use products with: Alpha-Hydroxy, Beta-Hydroxy, Benzyl Peroxide or Retinol.</li><br>
		<li>Do not use prescription acne medication with Retinoids such as Retin-A or Renova).</li><br>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Things that you <u>should</u> do post-treatment, IMMEDIATELY:
	<ul>
		<li>Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and cold water.</li><br>
		<li>Apply moisturizer, your skin will need to be moisturized often.</li><br>
		<li>Eye Makeup and lipstick only for the entire day.</li><br>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Things that you <u>should</u> do post-treatment, BEFORE YOU SLEEP:
	<ul>
		<li>Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and cold water.</li><br>
		<li>Use Anti-Inflammatory creams or a cold compress if you see any swelling.</li><br>
		<li>Apply Aloe Vera just prior to sleep to help you skin heal quicker.</li><br>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Things that you <u>should</u> do post-treatment, FOLLOWING DAYS:
	<ul>
		<li>Apply Aloe Vera if you are not going to apply any type of concealer or foundation.</li><br>
		<li>Apply a copper-based lotion, which tends to be light enough to apply foundation over.</li><br>
		<li>If you do choose to apply foundation, I recommend Lycogel Camouflage Foundation.</li><br>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Lycogel Camouflage Foundation is completely breathable and will not irritate your skin post-treatment. If you plan to use foundation post-treatment, I would recommend you buy this before you ever receive microdermabrasion treatment. Great for covering any redness.</p>
<br>

<h3>When you finally <u>smile</u> at yourself in the mirror...</h3>

<p>I learned that if you're serious about getting rid of your acne scars, then microdermabrasion is definitely where you will be able to accomplish this.</p>

<p>If you can afford to pay for multiple treatments with your dermatologist or aesthetician, then I highly recommend that you do that. It's definitely worth seeking the help of a professional who can provide you useful information that is unique to your situation.</p>

<p>But, if you're like me and can't possibly afford multiple treatments, you'll be happy to realize that you can get almost the same results on your own- in the privacy of your own home. I'm happy with the Microdermabrasion at home kits that I own- and so is my wallet.</p>

<p>If you've been following my Journey so-far, I can only say thank you for sticking around all of this time. I hope that my actions have inspired you to take similar leaps of faith.</p>

<p>If you're new to this and want to take it step-by-step like I did then, you can follow my journey by reading How to Remove Acne Scars - Part 1 and How to Remove Acne Scars - Part 2.</p>

<p>Next, I will go over other types of treatments that you can receive from your dermatologist- I will mostly be focusing on dermatologists in Los Angeles, CA [and by special request Austin, TX].</p>
