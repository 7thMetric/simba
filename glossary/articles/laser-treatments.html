<p>How to get rid of Acne Scars - Part 6 - <q>Laser Treatments</q></p>
<br>

<h2>So, you've decided that you'd be better off with a Professional.</h2>

<p>As many of you already know, I'm super nerdy and prefer to do a lot of things on my own. But despite how independent I am, I do know that there are things in life that are better left in the hands of a Professional. I don't know about you, but to me, surgery involving weird-looking needles and lasers are on my list of things that I would never do at home.</p>

<p>The idea behind this article was caused by my friend Maria who got married last year. The stress of planning a wedding caused her get her first laser resurfacing done at Contour Dermatology in Rancho Cucamonga, California.</p>

<p>I was with her for the entire journey and asked the doctors and nurses a lot of questions. Below are the results of those visits as well as the hundreds of hours of online research.</p>

<h2>When to Consider a Professional Acne Scar Treatment</h2>

<p><q>My face isn't that bad.</q> Maria said. My friend Maria often stops by, unannounced, when she finds herself facing a tough decision regarding her skin.</p>

<p>Maria continued, <q>Not bad enough to require a doctor, right?</q></p>

<p>You see, Maria was excited and counting down 30 days until her wedding day.</p>

<p>But with all of the planning and stress, poor Maria woke up one morning with one of the worse breakouts that she'd ever experienced. It got worse the more she worried and then she finally, reached her breaking point.</p>

<p><q>She said at least my vale would be covering my face!</q> Maria pouted- she was referring to her future mother in-law who loved to poke fun at Maria's acne.</p>

<p>Maria just sat on my couch, quietly hugging a pillow, with a head full of doubts.</p>

<p><q>If you get the laser treatment now, you'll be healed before your wedding day.</q> I replied-handing her a cup of chamomile tea to help her relax.</p>

<p>Like a lot of people, my friend Maria just didn't know if her dermatologist would be able to help her with something that wasn't an emergency.</p>

<p>This is a common misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The truth is, your master aesthetician or dermatologist will always be there to advise you. You just need to ask. You'd be surprised to hear how much they would be able to help you.</p>

<p>The following information is the result of almost a year of non-stop research about laser resurfacing. I hope that this will help you better understand what options are available. I plan to also go over other types of Scar Treatment procedures such as Subcision and Excision.</p>

<h2>Laser Treatment for Acne Scars - Is it worth it?</h2>

<p>

<b>Best for:</b> Acne scars on lighter skin. Both indented and raised scars.<br>
<b>Effective Rating:</b> Very effective.<br>
<b>Estimated Down-Time:</b> 7-14 days.<br>
<b>Full Recovery Time:</b> Ablative, 3-4 months. Non-Ablative, 1-2 months.<br>
<b>Estimated Cost:</b> $700.00 - $2,000.00 per session.<br>
<br>

</p>

<p>When I first spoke with Maria, I recommended that she look into laser treatment. I suggested this treatment because at that point I had already did a lot of research about the process and already located a Dermatologist in the Los Angeles area.</p>

<p>I was fully confident in my decision to get the treatment done on myself. I just couldn't possibly afford the quoted price of $750.00 per session.</p>

<p>But, for a super special day like Maria's wedding, the treatment was more than worth it.</p>

<p>From all of my research on laser resurfacing, I learned that there are two types of lasers:
	<ul>
		<li> Ablative</li>
		<li> Non-Ablative</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Ablative is a direct laser on your skin that vaporizes the outer-epidermis. This is an outpatient procedure and because it completely destroys the epidermis, it stimulates your body to generate completely new skin. The down-time for this procedure is ridiculously long. According to Dr. Marc Schneider of Fort Meyers Plastic Surgery, <q>An aggressive complete resurfacing will take 10 days to heal, 3-4 months for redness to fade and 3 months for maximum collagen in-growth.</q></p>

<p>Non-Ablative, on the contrary, heats the underlying dermis, causing the epidermis to die and slough off naturally- revealing new, softer skin. A non-ablative procedure would heal in less than 7 days and will be unnoticeable in about a month. Results will continue to show for up to six months when the collagen starts to fully re-generate.</p>

<p>Laser resurfacing is a very effective option but is not recommended for people with darker complexions or people who are prone to keloid scarring.</p>

<p>

<blockquote><q style="font-size:130%">
What this [non-ablative laser] does is evens out skin texture and tone, reduces fine lines and wrinkles. 'Can be used for acne scars. And it remodels collagen. So, you actually see results immediately from resurfacing and then down the road in 6 months from the collagen remodeling.

<h2>Laser Resurfacing - What to do before treatment</h2>

<p>
You will want to follow very similar precautions to those mentioned in my Chemical Peel and Microdermabrasion post:
	<ul>
		<li>6 to 8 weeks prior: Stay out of the sun. Yes, you will once again turn into a vampire. It's recommended that you start wearing SPF 40+ sunblock daily for this period if you really must go outside.</li><br>
		<li>7 days prior: Stop using any products that could affect the sensitivity of your skin such as AHA's, BHA's or pretty much anything with the word <q>Acid</q> in its name.</li><br>
		<li>7 days prior: Stop using medication that contain Vitamin-A such as Retin-A and Retinol. Again, this will affect your skin's sensitivity.</li><br>
		<li>7 days prior: Stop taking aspirin and alcohol. Your skin will bleed and weep after treatment and avoiding any products that could thin your blood is a good idea.</li><br>
	</ul>
Next, you will need to do some shopping.<br>
<br>

Ready?<br>
</p>
<br>

Ok, now, you will need to anticipate the expected down-time. Expect that you will be stuck in your home anywhere from 4 days to 2 weeks. You will need to plan ahead for basic needs, post-treatment healing and boredom. Here is the list that I helped Maria Put together:
<p><b>Medication not on the <q>Forbidden</q> List</b>

	<ul>
		<li>Birth Control pills</li>
		<li>Dr. Prescribed Antibiotics - Made aware that she was on B.C.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Supplies to help with healing</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Neova CU3 Post-Laser Lotion - Contains Copper Peptides to speed-up healing.
		<li>EltaMD Laser Post Procedure Balm - Moisturizes and cools skin.
		<li>Hairbands to keep hair out of your face when applying products.
		<li>Hydrocortisone Cream 1% - To help sooth any discomfort.
		<li>Benedryl - To help sooth any discomfort and help you sleep.
		<li>Obagi Gentle Cleanser - To keep your skin clean to avoid infection.
		<li>Apple Cider Vingear - To kill bacteria on your skin to avoid infection.
		<li>Oxygenetix or Lycogel Breathable Foundation - So that you can go outside if you need to.
		<li>SPF 40+ Sunblock - You will again be in <q>Vampire-Mode</q> for a couple of weeks.
	</ul>
</p>
	
<p>We also created a Grocery List meant to last for up to 2 weeks as well as a list of movies, books and magazines that would allow her to stay indoors for the entire 2 weeks without going insane.</p>

<h2>Laser Resurfacing - Post-Treatment Instructions</h2>

<h3>Post-Treatment - The First 24 Hours</h3>

<p>The first 24 hours will be hard. You will not like what you see in the mirror. You will be red, you may see a bit of bleeding/skin-weeping and your face will feel like a mild sun-burn.</p>

<p>Do not touch your face or apply any makeup. It will suck, I know, but trust me it's for your own good and you will love the end result.</p>

<p>Instead, apply the Neova CU3 Post Laser lotion. This lotion contains copper peptides which will help your skin start healing extremely quickly.</p>

<p>A little info on Copper Peptides: Copper has been used since the 60's for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. More recently, scientists have learned that they also help with the generation of collagen, elastin and skin-plumping hyaluronic acid. This, in my opinion, makes it the perfect post laser resurfacing treatment lotion.</p>

<p>You may also apply the EltaMD Laser Post Procedure Balm. This will help with moisturizing your skin- a perfect balm to use in-combination with CU3 lotion.</p>

<h3>Post-Treatment - The Day After</h3>

<p>After the first 24 hours, the swelling will start to subside and you will no longer be bleeding. You may see some minor weeping but it should have mostly ceased.</p>

<p>This will make it safe to start washing your face.</p>

<p>You will now need to start washing your face 2-3 times a day. This is to keep your skin clean and ensure that your new wounds do not get infected.</p>

<p>Maria was terrified of infection and to help alleviate her worries, she was prescribed an antibiotic before her treatment. It wouldn't hurt to ask your dermatologist about this before-hand. Also take note that if you're on Birth Control, there are certain antibiotics that will interfere with your baby-blocker working properly, inform your doctor that you're on B.C.</p>

<p>I suggested that Maria use Obagi Gentle Cleanser because I've been using their products for years. Definitely the best that I've experienced so far with a gentle cleanser.</p>

<h3>Post-Treatment - 48 hours After Treatment</h3>

<p>After 2 days you will start to notice that the swelling is starting to go down and your face is getting redder. This is normal and your skin will start to peel soon. Gross, I know, but again, you will be impressed with your results after about a week.</p>

<p>After 48 hours, you will want to apply Apple Cider Vinegar to your face. This is another preventative measure to ward off any bacteria and prevent infection.</p>

<p>Soak a clean face towel in 1 Tsp of Apple Cider Vinegar diluted in 1 cup of cool water. Place this cloth on your face for about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>You will want to do this after each time you wash your face- about 2-3 times per day.</p>

<p>After soaking, rinse with cool water and re-apply Neova CU3 Post Laser Lotion and EltaMD Laser Post Procedure Balm.</p>

<h3>Post Treatment - Day 3 to Day 10</h3>

<p>Continue to wash your face with Obagi Gentle Cleanser, soaking with Apple Cider Vinegar and apply Neova CU3 and EltaMD Balm to clean skin.</p>

<p>About 72 hours after treatment, you should start to see your skin peeling.</p>

<p>You can cover the redness with a high-grade mineral make-up, I personally would recommend Oxygenetix or Lycogel Breathable Foundation, which I use normally anyway.</p>

<p>At about day 8, your swelling should be almost non-existent and most of the dead skin will have sloughed off. You may have a bit of redness still, which can easily be covered with makeup.</p>

<p>From there, it's just waiting for your skin to fully heal. You will start seeing daily improvement.</p>

<h2>And then, the church organ started to play...</h2>

<p>I tapped my sandal on the hardwood floor of the church in anticipation.</p>

<p>The flower girls that they had seemed to be endless.</p>

<p>And then, after 30 days of hiding indoors, Maria appeared in a beautiful white dress with her father at her side. She was smiling ear to ear.</p>

<p>She was absolutely radiant.</p>

<p><q>Wow, look at how soft her skin looks</q>, I overheard a group of her Mother In-Law's friends say.</p>

<p>As she walked down the aisle, she looked over at me, smiled, and mouthed the words <q>Thank you</q>. That's when I realized how much this stuff is actually worth. It's worth a smile from a girl who never truly felt beautiful. And that, is priceless.</p>

<p>In my next article, I will go over more invasive Acne Scar Surgeries such as Subcision and Excision.</p>
