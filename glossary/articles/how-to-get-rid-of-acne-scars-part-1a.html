<h2>Yes, I was <u>that</u> desperate.</h2>

<p><q>Oh, my&hellip;</q> I sob on the inside as I stare at a circular dark spot that wasn't there when I left for work this morning. It's now 4:00 PM and just hours earlier this spot was just a pimple that had come to a head. </p>

<p>I shouldn't pop my pimples. I know this but I can't help it.</p>

<p>I'm sure this story sounds very familiar to you. If not, then, I guess you're just one of the lucky ones and I'm so pissed at you right now.</p>

<p>If you're reading this then I'm going to make a few assumptions. I'm assuming that you've suffered with Acne as a teenager and you've tried searching for a cure only to find an overwhelming amount of <q>stuff</q> online.</p>

<p>Some of the information is informative, kinda-sorta, but, the thing is, it's hard to tell exactly what you should do. The information is too scattered and some are even dangerous-sounding. I mean, I read an article that said to apply Acetone to my face. Yikes!</p>

<p>I know this because I was there and I've looked through it all. Yes, I really was that desperate and I really am that nerdy. </p>

<p>But alas, I'm happy to report: There is a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<h2>Step 1. What's Happening to Me!?, What is a Scar?</h2>

<p>After discovering that a scar was forming on my face literally in front of my eyes, I decided to take immediate action. </p>

<p>I was like a cyborg, scanning my face or foreign objects that needed to be destroyed.</p>

<p>I spent the next 4 hours on Google, searching for something- anything, that made sense to me. <q>Remove Scars from Acne</q>, <q>Remove Acne Scars Naturally</q> and many, many more searches. </p>

<p>As I learned more about what a scar actually was, I started to understand what types of home remedies might actually work. </p>

<p>So what is a scar exactly? To understand this, let's take a closer look at our skin:</p>

<p>Gross, I know.</p>

<p>Ok, a scar happens when the dermis part of the skin is damaged. A scab is created to temporarily cover the wound while the body creates a more permanent fix.</p>

<p>This fix takes place behind the scenes as collagen fibers mend the damaged skin. This <q>mend</q> is what we call a Scar. Since the skin cells on your face are smaller than the skin on say, your arm, something as little as a pimple is capable of causing the skin to scar.</p>

<p>There are two general types of scars caused by Acne: Raised Scars and Indented Scars.</p>

<p>How you approach removing them, depends on first identifying them.</p>

<p>A raised scar is scientifically known as a keloid. It is excess collagen fibers and they are raised above the skin.</p>

<p>Indented scars are commonly separated into three types: Ice-Pick Scars, Rolling Scars and Boxcar Scars. But they all have the same appearance, indentations in your skin.</p>

<h3>I needed something, now!</h3>

<p>Once I understood what I was looking at, I was no longer desperate, I was determined. I remember feeling that if I took action now, I may be able to save my face from yet another Acne Scar. I did not have the time or money for a dermatologist and I needed something, now! I decided on a Two-Step, combination treatment.</p>

<p>Believing that I was now a pimple scar removing cyborg, I went to the grocery store to get my weapons.</p>

<h3>SHOPPING LIST - Ingredients with Benefits</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><u>BROWN SUGAR:</u></dt>
		<dd>Perfect for this recipe. The small particles in sugar makes a perfect exfoliate.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>ORGANIC OLIVE OIL:</u></dt>
		<dd>We want olive oil with the least amount of chemical processing, if Virgin is all you have then it will do. Olive Oil is nature's moisturizer, providing a natural source of Vitamin-E which heals scars on your skin.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>COCONUT OIL:</u></dt>
		<dd>A natural source of Lauric, Caprylic and Capric acid. Coconut oil is known to have properties that fade scars.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>RAW HONEY:</u></dt>
		<dd>Honey has two perfect properties for this scrub. Honey is an anti-inflammatory and reduces redness in your skin. Also, application of Honey to the skin has an osmotic effect, which means it releases Hydrogen Peroxide. This kills bacteria, preventing breakouts.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>NUTMEG:</u></dt>
		<dd>Traditionally used to treat eczema and other skin ailments. Ayurvedic Medicine, one of the world's oldest medical systems, promotes nutmeg for its astringent and antibacterial properties.</dd><br>
	<dt><u>CINNAMON</u></dt>
		<dd>Originally used in Sri Lanaka for its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. Cinnamon and nutmeg together make an excellent team!</dd><br>
	<dt><u>LEMON</u></dt>
		<dd>Vitamin C, which is one of nature's Skin Lighteners. Great for help fading scars. Note: Your skin will become sensitive to UV light, ie: you will burn in the sun like a vampire. I recommend you plan your treatment after sunset.</dd><br>

<h2>Step 2. Exfoliate - Don't Treat Dead Skin</h2>

<p>Our goal here is to scrub off the old, dead skin on the epidermis part of your skin to reveal the young skin underneath. We will be using sugar as our exfoliator because it has the added benefit of being a cheap natural source of Glycolic Acid. Glycolic Acid breaks up the <q>glue</q> holding dead skin cells together. And in such a low concentration, it won't hurt you.</p>

<p>The collagen on the surface will need to be slowly broken down over time if the scar is old.  If the scar is new and starting to form, this will start to lighten your scar to the point of being unnoticeable. The following is a recipe that I found to work well.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
	<li>1/2 Cup - Brown Sugar, granulated sugar if you absolutely have to.</li>
	<li>1/2 Tbsp - Certified Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Virgin if you absolutely have to.</li>
	<li>1/2 Tbsp - Organic Coconut Oil</li>
	<li>1 Tbsp - Organic Raw Honey or Manuka Honey, optional</li><br>
</ul>

<p>And of course, a bowl and something to stir with.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<dl>
	<dd>Take <q>Before Photo</q> to compare later.</dd><br>
	<dd>Add 1/2 Tbsp of Extra Virgin Olive Oil into your bowl.</dd><br>
	<dd>Add 1/2 Tbsp of Coconut Oil into your bowl.</dd><br>
	<dd>Add your Honey.</dd><br>
	<dd>Start stirring until the ingredients start to bind and thicken.</dd><br>
	<dd>Slowly add in your Brown Sugar and test the texture until you get your right amount of <q>Scrubby</q> that you are comfortable with.</dd><br>
</dl>

<h3>How to Use</h3>

<dl>
	<dd>Gently apply to your face in circular motions. Don't scrub too hard.</dd><br>
	<dd>Leave on your Face for about 5 minutes and rinse with lukewarm water.</dd><br>
	<dd>You don't need to do a thorough job; this is just making sure you're not lightening dead skin.</dd><br>
</dl>


<h2>Step 3 - Lighten Those Scars!</h2>

<p><blockquote><q style="font-size:150%">Kojic Acid, Arbutin and Vitamin C are great alternative ingredients to look for in lightening creams.</blockquote></q>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>-Tina Alster MD</strong>, Georgetown University Professor of Dermatology</p>

<p>The next part of the Treatment is to lighten your scars and blemishes. This part will tingle a bit and it's important that you immediately wash the mask off if you feel any sort of pain.</p>
<p>Always spot-test your diluted lemon-juice. A little bit on the skin behind your ear will quickly tell you if this stuff will tickle, tingle or make you feel like your skin is on fire.</p>
<p>After using this mask, your skin will be sensitive to UV light. That means SPF 30 Toner, or Sunblock and Aloe Vera. Do not tan after using this mask. Please don't.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
	<li>1/2 Tbsp Cinnamon</li>
	<li>1/2 Tbsp Nutmeg</li>
	<li>1 Tbsp Organic Raw Honey or Manuka Honey</li>
	<li>1 Tbsp Evian or other Alkaline Water</li>
	<li>4-5 Drops of lemon juice - Spot test your skin's sensitivity first!</li><br>
</ul>

<p>And of course, a bowl and your trusty, clean, stirring tool- spoon, spatula, chop-stick, whatever.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<dl>
	<dd>Add 4-5 drops of lemon juice into your bowl, dilute this with 1 Tbsp of Evian water. Add more lemon juice drop-by-drop if your skin is not as sensitive to it.</dd><br>
	<dd>Add 1 Tbsp of organic raw honey and stir until the ingredients thicken. If the ingredients are too watery, add more honey to get the right <q>pasty</q> consistency. If you have to, heat up your honey.</dd><br>
	<dd>Add 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon and 1/2 Tbsp nutmeg into your bowl and stir.</dd><br>
</dl>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
<dl>
	<dd>Gently and evenly apply to your face.</dd><br>
	<dd>Do not scrub! The small cinnamon and nutmeg particles will rub against your face if you apply it too roughly. This will cause the lemon juice to go deeper into your skin and cause burns, ouch!</dd><br>
	<dd>Leave on your face between 10 to 20 minutes- shorter if you feel any pain.</dd><br>
	<dd>Wash the mask off with warm water and apply SPF 30 Toner/Moisterizer/Sun-block and Aloe Vera if you have it. The lemon juice will make your skin sensitive to UV light.</dd><br>
	<dd>Take <q>After photo</q> to compare to <q>Before photo</q> and to document changes over time.</dd><br>
</dl>	

<h3>Help! Red Face! My Face is turning into a Tomato!</h3>

<p>If you noticed that your face was turning red after exfoliating then you probably scrubbed your face too hard. As humans, we tend to focus on achieving quicker results and often over-do it.</p>

<p>Lesson learned.</p>

<p>Let your face rest for a few weeks before you exfoliate again and remember that it's your face that you're scrubbing, not pots and pans.</p>

<p>Besides, your lemon mask will remove whatever your slow, gentle exfoliate didn't so you don't need to scrub your face fully and completely.</p>

<p>Now, there may be a mild redness on your face after exfoliating, which will go away within an hour. If your redness continues and water seems to burn your face then it is a sure sign that you were scrubbing too hard.</p>

<p>After your Lemon Mask, your skin will be extremely sensitive. You just applied a mild acid to your face and you will see some redness and peeling. This is normal.</p>

<p>Don't repeat the regiment until the redness goes away.</p>

<p><blockquote><q style="font-size:150%">The signals that you're using your exfoliator too much include: excessive dryness, irritation, redness, and sensitivity</blockquote></q>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>-Dennis Gross M.D. </strong>, Dermatologist, NYC.</p>


<h2>Getting rid of Acne Scars is a Process</h2>

<p>Repeat this regiment no more than 2 times a week.</p>

<p>Some of the biggest mistakes that we make are caused by wanting instant results and over-doing it. Less is more ladies, trust me.</p>

<p>I was a part of the <q>get rid of acne scars overnight</q> crowd who would try things to <q>see what happens</q>. As if Aphrodite herself would come down and give me my face back.</p>

<p>Wishful thinking.</p>

<p>I know now that finally being free from my blemishes and scars caused by my acne will be a process. Even dermatologists have to treat you over a period of sessions. I understand this now and I'm committed to getting results slowly over time.</p>

<p>I will continue to document my journey. I hope that you found Part-1 informative! </p>

<p>In Part-2, I will go over a homemade Chemical Peel that you can make from scratch. Super helpful if you're a broke Waitress like I was.</p>
